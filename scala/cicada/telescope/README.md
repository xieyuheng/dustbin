- telescope can not handle join between values
  we need unification to handle this
  - we need logic_variable again
- no dot_type
- use type_t in type_t
- need unification for refine_choice and join_val
  - the only place where unification is needed ?
  - to deal with information lost
    x.length and y.length is infered as the same
- need to filter choices
------
- @assert_not_check for testing
- subtype relation between class and supers
- [maybe] value of a field must be full value -- full_p, part_p
- string_t
- check undefined during top loading
- termination check
------
- [note] we do not need readback to implement fulfill
  - we only need readback to handle eqv_t
- [note] is it ok to not use NormEnv in NormTel and NormNeuChoice ?
