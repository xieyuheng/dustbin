- bind
- eval
- unify, walk, deep
- if we use logic variable
  we still need env to implement eval
  but we can not use env in member and club, we can only use bind
  otherwise we can not implement join

------

we can not view partially fulfilled data as function,
unless we are willing to use named function call syntax,
because the data passed into a function might be more fulfilled than
the typed variable in the function definition.
